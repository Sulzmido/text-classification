 It was not an excuse, it is an unnecessary detail.

The only important part is she finds out it is inside her, she gets it removed. Don't be bitchy in edit summaries, it's tedious.

Given Weyland's instructions to infect somebody (whether David picked Holloway because he patronised him, or whether Weyland picked him, is unclear) at the cost of their own life to get hold of Engineer genetics, """"an ulterior motive"""" - that they are more interested in the alien than in her, and that they don't share her Ripley-ish instincts that the alien just needs to be killed - is a pretty clear inference. Or alternatively she might just be worried that Vickers will kill her with a flamethrower when she finds out Shaw is also """"infected"""". Either way, I suspect other people may feel the same - and indeed it's the sort of plot point which somebody whose attention has drifted or who has nipped out for a pee could miss at first viewing.

The edit on Paganism is right. Paganism is a CLASS of religions just like helicopter is a CLASS of aircraft, or planet is class of heavenly bodies.

Double Standard reloaded
Who is interested in debating and who is not?
Who is interested in developing the article and
who is interested in freezin it to death, including using threats and veiled censorship in the form of selective double standard applying of internal rules?

After all, it never too much to remind that:
an editor besides not been unwilling or unable to counter argue, over a year and a half, he also have done baseless statements about editions done by me in a certain rude tone,
During all this time, I have responded to him in the same mode, but especifically to these assertions,
not having any left unanswered, unlike him...
...and only me is who was warned and blocked
Curious...
  

""""Summary of operations""""
To the newcomers in this discussion and also to the selective forgetful ones:

See above The heart of this Case;
As well as the sections Spurious Quotations, Once Again, and sections Warning to Judge by yourselves II in my Talk Page;

To note that 
1) from grammatical objections to the size of version that I propose, no one objection was left standing and even so it continues to be reversed, 
even taking into account that the present version: 
incurs spurious quote in the 1st paragraph, 
too detailed and redundant information (for an article that are supposed to be short...) on the 2nd paragraph, 
and incomplete besides be longer, vague and non neutral in the 3rd...

2) How not to think in double standard when:

The last disruptive revertion, besides be longer than the version I propose, was based entirely on incorrect inferences and historical misconceptions as I shown above (again... See above points A to E in """"Once Again"""" section ) that were related only to the 2nd paragraph (of the version I propose);
and that
No word was uttered against or about the spuriousness that was purged of the 1st paragraph, as well as against or about the 3rd paragraph, that according to some editor (Ctr F on word """"solid"""" to see above, on the discussion about grammar in the """"Once Again"""" section), was """"pretty solid""""...

And even so, the revertion was done...

So, I again ask you all:

1) Is the spuriousness justifiable under any circunstances?

2) In the case of an encyclopedia that is intended to be free and neutral, which group of honest editors would admit the use of partial referrals that lead to political and historical inferences in favor of a political regime (monarchical, military, etc.) whatever be?

Worse, which group of honest editors would allow the use of spurious citations of a partial source for purposes mentioned above - even if this purposes are involuntary, although the time that passed without actions having been taken, as well as the resistance to remediation maintained, only makes this possibility (of involuntariness) unlikely???

3) Which group of honest editors, ladies and gentlemen, who were truly committed to the freedom and neutrality of such instrument, would vote against such remediation or would omit about it?

There is nothing about Paris Hilton Racing, her Spanish based Moto GP team! Moto GP is the most important and viewed motorcycle racing competition in the world, and her team had an incredible 2011 season. This certainly raised her profile in Europe in terms of media coverage. If there are no objections I would like to add the following to the article under motorsport:  

""""Paris Hilton in partnership with Blusens-BQR (Queroseno Racing) and intially sponsor SuperMartxe VIP entered a race team in the 2011 125cc Moto GP World Championship in the last year of the 125cc category that has run since 1949. Originally the team was called """"SuperMartxe VIP by Paris Hilton Racing"""" but that was later changed to """"Blusens by Paris Hilton Racing"""". The Spanished based team raced the Italian Aprilia RSA 125 motocycle with two Spanish pilots, 16-year old European champion Maverick Viñales and vetern Sergio Gadeo. The Moto GP team was led by Raúl Romero, with Ricard Jové as sporting and technical director, and with Christian Lundberg and highly respected Italian technician Rossano Brazzi preparing the bikes. Both pilots finished in the top ten. Maverick Viñales finished third overall in the 125cc Moto GP World Riders Championship, with four Grand Prix wins and a total of nine podiums, and three fatest laps and three poles. Sergio Gadeo finished ninth overall and achieved 2 third place finishes giving the team an impressive 11 podiums in their first season. Marick Viñales won the Gran Premio Gernerali de la Comunitat Valenciana, the final Grand Prix of the season, earning points for both Blusens by Paris Hilton Racing and Aprilia who won the 125cc Moto GP World Manufaturers Championship. Paris Hilton said """"it has been an amazing year for my team"""".""""

i appreciate u tagging the kannadiga article as its tone isn't pretty good. the problem is a user named User:C21K, seems to be a kannada chauvanist and hates all other people .he has been repeatedly vandalising the pages related to tulu konkani and tamil people and culture and also is responsible for the mess that has been made in the kannadiga article.he cites every tulu and konkani or other linguistic minorities of karnataka as kannadiga and also suggests that lingayatism as the original faith of karnataka.it is better he his banned from wikipedia can u do something about it.anyways do you have any other plans to improve articles related to karnataka and its people including the kannadiga article .by User:Princeofdark07"

0,"AfD warning 

It looks as if other people trying to show you were you are going wrong haven't had any success, so I'll make it clear: if you continue to nominate articles for deletion which are about notable subjects (as established after spending some effort on Google searches), you will be blocked. 

Not every AfD needs to be successful, many of my AfDs end in keep or no consensus. But starting an AfD for lack of notability without doing any effort to find sources yourself is against policies and guidelines, and continuing to do so after it has been explained to you is disruptive. Speedy deletion criteria have nothing to do with this, and don't apply to films and so on anyway; but note that e.g. a record can only be speedy deleted if the musician or band are a redlink: similarly, we wouldn't speedy delete a film article where the main actors are bluelinks even if we had a speedy criterion for films."

Hello, Zsuetam. A request has been made at Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations to usurp, or """"take over"""", your username because you have not used it to edit, and another user would like to use it to edit. Wikipedia:Changing username/Usurpations says that any unused username may be usurped if the user is given an opportunity to object and does not do so. 

If you have an email set in your preferences, you should be getting an email from a bureaucrat or changing username clerk explaining how to consent or object to this process. 

If you do not object to being renamed to a new username in order for another user to use the name you currently have, please log in and post a reply here saying so (you may also tell us what username you would like to be renamed to, or we will provide you with a generic one). 

If you do nothing: the request may be filled shortly, and your account will be moved to a generic username. You may request that it be moved to a new username of your choice at any time.

If you object to being renamed: please log in and make an edit to this page clearly stating that you object to usurpation. 

Please note that even if your current username is usurped, you can still edit and your data will not be lost; your preferences, watchlist, and other user settings will be transferred to a new username.
